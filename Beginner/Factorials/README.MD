# FACTORIALS

## Description

My motivation for this project is to solve problems in python. I built this project to utilize the basic concepts of python. This project validates user inputs, finds the factorial of any given number. This project taught me to write simple unit tests, implement recursion, read user inputs and import multiple modules.
