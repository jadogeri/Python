# AGE VALIDATION TOOL

## Description

My motivation for this project is to solve problems in python. I built this project to utilize the basic concepts of python. This project validated user age (only numbers as input) checking if user was allowed to carry out different activities. This project taught me to write simple unit tests, read user inputs and import multiple modules.
